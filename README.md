## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes
- App: Spotify
  - Making playlists
  - Playlist recommendation system
  - Group sessions
- App: Pinterest
  - Making Pinterest boards
  - Saving Pins
  - Sharing boards
- App: Doordash
  - Saving restaurants
  - Sorting by type of food
  - Customer support
 
- App Idea: An app idea I have is a travel app that connects travelers with locals for authentic experiences. This app would allow travelers to select the area that they are visiting and find locals who are offering unique experiences such as tours, home-cooked meals, language learning, etc. A feature this app might have is allowing travelers to filter by price range, such as budget, mid-range, luxury, etc. On the other hand, locals will be able to post experiences that they are offering and at what cost. After, the travelers will be able to rate and review their experience, so that other travelers know what to expect when booking with this host.
 
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- I initially struggled with the layout of Xcode and discovering what each button did. I also had difficulty finding out how to drag the button inside the ViewController class.
